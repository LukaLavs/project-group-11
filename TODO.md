# TODOs

- Fix `report.tex` front page!!! Leave other text as template.
- Study `metaheuristics` on graphs 
find a mixed integer linear programming model for `max` problem. Implement it 
as a new method in `MILP.ipynb` class
- use methods above to test for conjecture. Provide visual insights. Present information 
**compactly**, no weird tables without context.
- Generate images for cyclomatic graph problems `min` and `max`. Describe simulated-anneling as used in 
`simulated-anneling.py` in **report.tex**.
- Study alleged new proof of conjecture. Given in README.
