# TODOs

- Fix `report.tex` front page. Leave other text as template.
- Create description.tex file.
- Study `metaheuristics` on graphs 
(genetic algorithms, simulated anneling, greedy search). To find graphs with minimal `cM2`.
- Prove correctness of the function `optimal_k(n)`. Details in Mathematica file.
- test conjecture after learning about metaheuristic graph generation methods.
- Study alleged new proof of conjecture. Given in README.
